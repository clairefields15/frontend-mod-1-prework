## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

I enjoyed the article and thought they covered all of the major points. I don't currently read as much as I would like to, but when I was a child I read a ton because we did not have cable TV. One of my resolutions last year was to read 12 books and I think I went just over my target, thanks in large part to all of the audiobooks I listened to while I was at work! I definitely view learning as a process, adopt a growth mindset, and enjoy teaching others what I know. The point about taking care of your brain really resonated with me! After reading "Sleep" last year, I really began to prioritize getting 8+ hours of sleep per night (honestly I function best with 9-10) and I noticed huge gains in my mood and athletic performance. Sleep and nutrition are really big priorities of mine. One thing that I enjoy about Turing so far, are all of the poms, this is something I would like to integrate more into my studying. When it comes to "life" tasks, I think I do this naturally, but I do not integrate it into study as much as I want to.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Strings are zero or more characters written in quotations.  
Booleans can be either TRUE or FALSE.
Numbers can be written either as integers (whole numbers) or floats (decimals) and can be any number, negative or positive.
Arrays were not in this section, but they are collections of data.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
``` JavaScript  
var helloWorld = "Hello World!"
console.log(helloWorld)
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
Comments in a js file are used to write notes to help you and other developers understand the code. They will not be logged in the console. If you are playing around with code and want to run your file but not include certain lines, you can also separate them out into a comment.
`// makes a comment that is a single line long`
`/* use this when you want to write a really really long comment that will take up more than one line */`

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a container for data, a way to store data temporarily. To the 5 year old, I would say that a variable is like a sticker you put on your shirt that says "Hello my name is:" The sticker is the variable and your name is the data.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I use the weather app on my phone often. It stores my location (string), the currentCurrentTemp (integer), and the weather (string).  


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
Concatenation is combining several things together, such as concatenating words (strings) to make a sentence.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?  
On amazon, the developers have used concatenation to make the element `Deliver to ${yourName}` at the top of the page.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  
In what scenarios would it be better to use concatenation vs interpolation? Interpolation seems much quicker/easier to use overall...
