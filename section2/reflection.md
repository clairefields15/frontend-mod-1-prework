## Section 2 Reflection

**1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**

I tend to wait too long to ask questions because I really want to figure out the solution on my own. I am working on asking for help sooner!

**2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

I felt fairly confident about using the pared down directions. I ended up running my code in repl.it after some frustrations using node in the terminal. I struggled most learning about if statements (mostly the proper syntax, which will come with experience) so there was a lot of trial and error in running my code. I found learning about functions through the resources given to be pretty easy, and appreciated seeing the concept taught in a variety of ways. It made me realize that I am a very hands-on/visual person because I got the most value out of the video as compared to the JavaScript book and the blog post.

**3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

A conditional statement is a comparison of two different things that is evaluated `true` or `false`. You can check to see if the things are equal, not equal, if one is greater than or less than the other, etc. A daily life conditional could be "When I wake up, I am hungry." In this example, if it is true that it is 9am, then it is also true that I am hungry. On my trello board for mod0, conditionals are probably used to show my progress on a task (if 2 out of 4 boxes are checked, display 50% completed).

**4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if`. The programming reads the conditions in order and stops reading the remaining conditions when it finds one that is true, so order of conditions is really important! Let's say you have a little robot and you want him to do 8-10 pullups and then stop, you could write some code that says `if` he has done less than 8 pullups, tell him to keep going, `else if` he has done 8-10 pullups to encourage him to try hard, `else` if he has done more than 10 pullups to tell him to add weight next time.  

**5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**  

If you want to check that two conditions are met, you can use the logical operators `&&` (this AND that) or `||` (this OR that).   

**6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**

I just need more experience with the syntax of if statements, it's a lot of brackets and curly braces and semi-colons to keep track of! It took me a minute to figure out the solution to the puppy, adult, elderly example, which I think taught me the importance of ordering conditions properly.
