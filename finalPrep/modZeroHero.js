// Declare two variables - heroName AND specialAbility - set to strings
var heroName = "Bite Lady";

// Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
//   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses concatenation to include the heroName
//   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the specialAbility
var greeting = "Bonjour, I am " + heroName;

// Declare two variables - fullPower AND fullEnergy
//   fullPower should multiply your current power by 500
//   fullEnergy should add 150 to your current energy

var fullPower = power * 500;

// Print the first sidekick to your console
//console.log(sidekicks[0])

// Print the last archEnemy to the console
//console.log(archEnemies[2])

// Write some code to add a new archEnemy to the archEnemies array
//archEnemies.unshift("Cotton Candy Boy")

// Print the archEnemies array to console to ensure you added a new archEnemy
//console.log(archEnemies)

// Remove the first sidekick from the sidekicks array
//sidekicks.shift()

// Print the sidekicks array to console to ensure you added(removed?) a new sidekick
//console.log(sidekicks)

// Create a function called assessSituation that takes three arguments - dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse
//   - dangerLevel should be an integer
//   - saveTheDay should be a string a hero would say once they save the day
//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel

// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

//Test Cases
var announcement = 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'

// Declare a new variable - scaryMonster - assigned to an Object with the following key/values
//   - name (string)

// Reflection
// What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
/*I definitely did not complete the exercise within the 30 minute time limit. I
had a really hard time retaining/remembering information from the earlier sections, especially
the proper syntax (I got a kick out of the archNemesis name ðŸ˜†). When referring to my notes, I
wish that I had written out a lot more examples of code. I ended up referring to my previous work
which was helpful. Overall, I need more practice with the concepts,*/

// What parts felt most comfortable to you?
/* I felt most comfortable with declaring variables, else-if statements, creating
a class using the constructor function and class methods.
*/

// What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
/* I need to practice proper syntax overall, as well as more complex conditional statements
and functions. I want to get a new notebook and re-write my definitions and keywords to
include examples of proper use/syntax.  */
